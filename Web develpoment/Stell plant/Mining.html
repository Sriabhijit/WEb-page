<p class="mip">With a century of experience in mining raw materials, we understand the finite nature of natural resources and strive to uphold responsible mining practices.</p>
<p class="mip2">As a global and diversified mining business, we are committed to ensuring sustainable mining through all of our operations spread over the world. All our key mining sites are certiﬁed under EMS ISO 14001, the international environmental management standard. We have also adopted a holistic business model that looks at the entire value chain comprising of:
<br><br>• Steel Value Chain: From captive mining to downstream steel businesses.
<br>• Raw Materials Value Chain: The mining of chrome and manganese ore to production and sale of ferro-alloys & minerals.
<br>• Other Businesses: Such as equipment manufacturing, bearings and agricultural equipment manufacturing.

<br><br>Tata Steel has captive coal mines at Jharia & West Bokaro, in the state of Jharkhand, located within 200 km from Jamshedpur.

<p class="mip2">Our products include high-strength high-tech materials for use in extreme situations, innovative machinery , and even turnkey facilities . Our fully mobile crusher is a good example: It makes particularly efficient use of energy, because material is crushed directly at the mine face and transported away on conveyors. This eliminates the need for heavy truck haulage, which reduces operating costs and CO2 emissions.

<br><br>We are a world-leading supplier of carbon flat steel. Efficient warehousing and logistics systems guarantee rapid availability of our materials. We offer a wide range of services and products from a single source. We have a proven track record of supporting customers in the mining and metals industry in all types of project.</p>
