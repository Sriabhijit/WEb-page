    Vale has a logistics network that integrates mines, railroads, ships, and ports for fast and
     safe transportation of ore. Our infrastructure is used in Brazil, Indonesia, Mozambique, Oman,
     Malaysia, and China.

    Our logistics structure also carries third-party cargo and offers two passenger train lines in
    Brazil – Vitória-Minas railroad (EFVM) and Carajás railroad.</br></p>

    Vale operates nearly 2 thousand kilometers of railroad network in Brazil and has signed agreements
    to use some lines in Africa, creating one of its major competitive advantages.<br> There are still two
    important long-distance rail branches in operation for passenger trains.</br>

  To integrate operations in the five continents, Vale has a network of ports and terminals connected to the mines
  through railroads. Among them are deep-draft ports suitable for Valemax. The structures are used in Brazil,
  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Oman; in addition, they provide cargo services for third parties.
